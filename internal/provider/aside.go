// An aside is a question dispatchq asks a harness on its own behalf rather than
// to carry out the operator's work: the prompt review that checks a task before
// it is queued, the assistant chat, and the feedback assistant that drafts a
// GitHub issue.
//
// It is not a small run. A run does the user's work in the user's directory
// with the user's tools; an aside is dispatchq talking to a model about dispatchq,
// so it gets no tools, no project configuration, and a directory of its own.
// Keeping the two apart is what stops a review of a prompt from being steered
// by the repository the prompt talks about.

// AsideRequest is one turn of such a conversation.

	// Model is the model to answer with. Empty leaves the choice to the harness.
	Model string
	// System is the instruction set for the whole conversation. Harnesses record
	// it when a session starts and replay it on every resume, so it belongs to
	// the first turn; later turns leave it empty.
	System string
	// Text is what to say this turn.
	Text string
	// Schema is a JSON schema the answer must satisfy. Adapters that cannot
	// enforce one state the shape in System instead and parse what comes back.

	// SessionID identifies the conversation. DispatchQ issues it when the harness
	// accepts one; otherwise the adapter reports the harness's own id in the
	// answer and the caller sends that back.

	// Continues says another turn will follow, so the session has to outlive
	// this call. A single-question aside leaves it false and the harness is told
	// not to keep the conversation at all, which is what stops prompt review
	// from filling the operator's session history with throwaway turns.
